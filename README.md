# BankingSystem
```Upgraded version of this current project-->``` **https://github.com/SharonIV0x86/BankingSystem2.0**
Just a banking system with login functionality.

  Took me very long to write all that code i know there are many problems in the code and it looks complex.
  But i will fix the code while working on other stuff too, and will also be learning and practising regularly.üëç
  
  The human verification system used in this project is inspired from my other program
  https://github.com/SharonIV0x86/SignUp (SignUp is the name of the repository)
 
 # Working
 Even after working for a long time i was unable to fix the calculation issue with file input/output idk what to do
 at this point, everything else is pretty fine and works well. üëç
 
 # How to use?
 The program will compile on both windows and Linux, 
 tested platform(s) (Linux) and (windows) or any other OS with suitable compiler.
 
  For LINUX:
  If you git cloned the repository, and you are trying to run the main.cpp, there can be a issue with the file permissions if you see the program is
  not working fine or if the account balance stays 0 even after depositing the money, it is a request to provide some permissions to the program files
  so that additional text file can be generated to perform the calculations.
  
  For Windows:
  You can normally download the zip file or git clone. And compile main.cpp and everything else will be fine.
  
 
 
 1. You first need to create your account.
 2. Once you created your account you can simply login and use your account.
 3. You can deposit or withdraw money also.

# Cons
But remember trying to create more than one or more account is possible but the account balance and all will
be the same no matter how many accounts you will create all will lead to one.
And also there is no dedicated code to look for conflicting account credentials for example:
two accounts can share one pin number.


If you see any loose ends (btw there are many.) in the code feel free to raise and issue i will try to fix it.
