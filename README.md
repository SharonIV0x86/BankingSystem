# BankingSystem
Just a banking system with login system.

  Took me very long to write all that code i know there are many problems in the code and it looks complex.
  But i will fix the code while working on other stuff too, and will also be learning and practising regularly.üëç
  
  The human verification system used in this project is inspired from my other program

 # Working
 Even after working for a long time i was unable to fix the calculation issue with file input/output idk what to do
 at this point, everything else is pretty fine and works well but the only thing i couldn't do very well was file IO
 but dont worry i will fix that too!
 
 # How to use?
 The program will compile on both windows and Linux, tested platform(s) (Linux)
 
 
 1. You first need to create your account.
 2. Once you created your account you can simply login and use your account.
 3. You can deposit or withdraw money also.

# Cons
But remember trying to create more than one or more account is possible but the account balance and all will
be the same no matter how many accounts you will create all will lead to one.
And also there is no dedicated code to look for conflicting account credentials for example:
two accounts can share one pin number, yes that is also another problemo.
